# data-representation-project
Data Representation Project 2021

Write a program that demonstrates that you understand creating and consuming RESTful APIs. I will allow a lot of flexibility in this project, so that you can use it as an opportunity to do something that is useful for your work.
If you can’t think of a project to do:
•	Create a web application in Flask that has a RESTful API, the application should link to one or more database tables.
•	You should also create the web pages that can consume the API, ie. perform CRUD operations on the data.

Level 1: (24 – 27%):
•	A basic Flask server,
•	A REST API to perform CRUD operations,
•	One database table,
•	Accompanying web interface, using AJAX calls, to perform these CRUD operations.
Level 2: (24 – 30%):
•	Same as Level 1, but with two database tables instead of one.
Level 3: (30 – 33%):
•	Same as Level 2, but with authorization (logging in) included.
Extra Marks: (0 – 30%):
•	The web page looks nice: (0 – 6%)
•	A more complicated API: (0 – 6%)
•	Server Links to some third party API: (0 – 6%)
•	If the third party API requires authentication: (0 – 6%)
•	Hosted online (e.g. Azure, Pythonanywhere): (0 – 6%)
